## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulerability use the report a vulnerability feature on GitHub,
DM me (`TheSuperGamer20578`) on Discord (only if you have a mutual server with me, I will not be accepting random friend requests),
or create a *private* thread on [my discord server](https://discord.gg/ehqQUvvmc6) in the relevent support channel or `#misc-support` and mention me in it.
